Development Environment:

The development environment for this project centers around utilizing React Native, a versatile framework that ensures cross-platform compatibility for both Android and iOS devices. This choice streamlines development, allowing for efficient creation of a dynamic fitness app with a single codebase. In conjunction with React Native, we'll integrate Firebase as the database platform. Firebase's real-time database capabilities provide seamless data management and synchronization, enhancing the app's interactivity and responsiveness across different platforms.
